Enhancing Historical Paintings with Super-Resolution and Object Detection 
Developed a two-stage AI pipeline to improve the analysis of historical paintings. Applied the EDSR model for super-resolution to upscale low-resolution artwork, followed by YOLOv8 object detection to identify people and artifacts. Evaluated performance using mAP, precision, and recall, and supported interpretability with BLIP captioning and CLIP similarity scores.
